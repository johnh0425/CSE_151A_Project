## Milestone 2

### Initial Data Exploration:
The dataset contains 16 different subdirectories, each containing different audio samples. There is a total of 176,581 entries in the dataset, and upon looking at the dataset we noticed that many of the files were corrupted. Using the `pretty-midi` utility functions, we can extract the different attributes of the dataset. For the purposes of this project, we will be focusing on the following components: 
1.  `n_instruments`: the number of unique instruments in the file
2.  `tempo_estimate`: the estimated tempo of the file
3.  `program_numbers`: the unique integer value corresponding to the type of instrument used in the file. The list of program numbers can be found [here](https://midiprog.com/program-numbers/)
4.  `key numbers`: list of key value integers which represent the key signatures in the file
5.  `time_signature_changes`: list containing time signature changes in file (e.g.: 4/4 represents 4 beats in each measure (denoted by numerator) and the note value that represents 1 beat (denoted by denominator). In this example the 4 quarter-note beats is commonly used in many genres like classical, pop, and rock.)
6.  `end_time`: duration of the music piece
7.  `tempo`: a list of tempos (beats per minute) found in the file

### Preprocessing:
As mentioned in the data exploration section we have noticed that a lot of the entries contain corrupted audio files. We have decided to drop these entries as the dataset already contains a lot of entries. The files should already follow the [Standard MIDI Format](https://majicdesigns.github.io/MD_MIDIFile/page_smf_definition.html#:~:text=Standard%20MIDI%20File%20Format,page%20authoring%20and%20greeting%20cards.), so we do not need to do any additional standardization. We will not implement any encoding methods since all of the values we will be examining are continuous values.   

## Milestone 3
To refine and get the genre associated with the midi files, we had to extract the genre based on the given ID using the following [file](https://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/mir/msd/partitions/msd-MAGD-genreAssignment.cls).
